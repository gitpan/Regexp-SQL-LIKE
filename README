NAME
    Regexp::SQL::LIKE - Translate SQL LIKE pattern to a regular expression

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
       use Regexp::SQL::LIKE 'to_regexp';
 
       my $re = to_regexp( "Hello %" ); # returns qr/^Hello .*/

DESCRIPTION
    This module converts an SQL LIKE pattern to its Perl regular expression
    equivalent.

    Currently, only "%" and "." wildcards are supported and only "\" is
    supported as an escape character.

    No functions are exported by default. You may rename a function on
    import as follows:

       use Regexp::SQL::Like to_regexp => { -as => 'regexp_from_like' };

    See Sub::Exporter for more details on import customization.

FUNCTIONS
  to_regexp
      my $re = to_regexp( "Hello %" );

    This function converts an SQL LIKE pattern into an equivalent regular
    expression. A "%" character matches any number of characters like ".*"
    and a "." character matchs a single character. Backspaces may be used to
    escape "%", "." and "\" itself:

      to_regexp( "Match literal \%" );

    All other characters are run through "quotemeta()" to sanitize them.

    The function returns a compiled regular expression.
